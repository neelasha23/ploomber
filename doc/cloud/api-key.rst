6. The next step is setting this key in the Ploomber CLI: copy your key, and move to the next step.

*Note:  You can always go back to the login page and get your key from this page.*

*Note:  Users who registered can log in directly by clicking on the top right corner menu & sign in.*

Setting your API Key
********************

Ploomber Cloud is in beta, and the API might change in the future.
To use it, you'll have to install Ploomber from git.

.. code-block:: console

    pip uninstall ploomber
    pip install git+https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber@cloud-stable


Now, configure your API key:

.. code-block:: console

    ploomber cloud set-key {your-key}

You can validate that the key was set correctly by running the get command:

.. code-block:: console

    ploomber cloud get-key


You're now ready to use Ploomber Cloud! You use ``ploomber`` locally
and submit pipelines to the Cloud, or you can use a
hosted :ref:`JupyterLab <hosted-jupyterlab>` instance we provide for free,
so you don't have to set up an environment.

Check out the :doc:`following tutorial <guide>` to learn how to submit pipelines to the Cloud.

Or check the user guide to learn more about Ploomber Cloud's features.
